    <p>
        We have been trying French onion soup in restaurants for years, and my family and friends agree — none can compare to my recipe for taste and simplicity of preparation.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li> 
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li> 
      <li>4 cups sliced onions</li> 
      <li>5 cups beef broth</li> 
      <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li> 
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li> 
      <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li> 
      <li>4 slices French bread</li> 
      <li>4 slices provolone cheese</li> 
      <li>2 slices Swiss cheese, diced</li> 
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li> 
  
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
